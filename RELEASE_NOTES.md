## Document Heading
v0.3.0 — Deterministic Benchmarking & Governance Policy

## Overview

This release marks a stable reference milestone for EchoLattice, introducing deterministic benchmarking, aggregate-only governance signals, and verification tooling. The project now provides a fully auditable, bounded recursion engine suitable for research and engineering evaluation.

## Key Changes

- Deterministic recursion with reproducible grounding paths
- Built-in benchmarking (--benchmark) with JSONL outputs and markdown summaries
- Aggregate-only governance policy (no text or identity inspection)
- Verification tooling to enforce schema and regression guarantees
- Improved documentation and clarified project scope

## Safety & Governance

- Governance operates strictly on numeric, aggregate metrics
- No raw text, memory, or identity data is evaluated or stored
- Policy outputs are advisory and audit-focused

## Status

EchoLattice remains a reference implementation (v0.x), designed for clarity, reproducibility, and experimentation rather than production deployment.
